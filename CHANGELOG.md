## [1.0.0](https://github.com/TarekNajem04/Jeninnet.FileQuery/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Six sample projects covering basic matching, pattern language, recursive traversal, hybrid matching, regex matching, and advanced DI + CLI usage.
- BenchmarkDotNet benchmark suite covering all matchers, pattern tokenization, classification, and traversal.
- Architecture tests enforcing layer boundaries, zero-allocation contract, and matcher construction authority.
- Full XML documentation on all public members.
- Symbol packages (`.snupkg`) for debugger step-through support.

### Notes

- Targets `net10.0`. Requires .NET 10 or later.
- All three packages versioned together at `1.0.0`.
- The `PatternMatchingMode` property on `FileQueryOptions` applies only when `PatternInterpretationMode.Specific` is set. In the default `Hybrid` mode it is ignored.
- GitIgnore sub-set results take precedence over Glob and Regex sub-sets in hybrid mode. A **GitIgnore** inclusion is final; **Glob** and **Regex** matchers can re-include paths excluded by **GitIgnore** ***but cannot exclude paths that GitIgnore has included***.
